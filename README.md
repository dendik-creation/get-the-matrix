# Get The Matrix - Play while learning math


## Introduction
Get The Matrix is a game name that refers to learning mathematics about the matrix. Get The Matrix was made by a team consisting of 3 members, including, I act as a game programmer, my partner acts as a game designer, and my mentor as an advisor.

Get The Matrix was born on the basis of the habit of students that learning mathematics using conventional models seems boring, so we took the initiative to design games with the theme of mathematics.

Get The Matrix only supports Indonesian language.
